# Archeology meets Image Processing

From some time to now, the Vatican Library has released many digitized
[documents](https://digi.vatlib.it/). Some of those documents are the __Aztec
codices__, which are from special interest to the Mesoamerican Archeology.

The idea of this project is to _explore_ at least one of those codices. The
the codices available are:

- [Codex Borgia](https://digi.vatlib.it/view/MSS_Borg.mess.1)
- [Codex Vaticanus B 3773](https://digi.vatlib.it/view/MSS_Vat.lat.3773)

## Tasks in mind

- Scrape images.
- Apply simple image preprocessing, such as, delete borders or enhance contrast.
- Color analysis: Can lead to simple, but still, interesting data visualizations (R has rich data visualization toolset).
- Extract the symbols.
- Identify similar symbols (maybe using clustering).
- Identify simple patterns.
